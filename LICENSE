                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free software license that guarantees end
users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. It is
designed to protect your freedom to share and change all versions of a program
to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software
Foundation, use the GPL for most of our software; it applies to any program
whose authors commit to using it. (If a program is released under the GPL with
the intent of making it free software, that program can later be modified and
re-released under different licenses by the authors.) You can apply the GPL to
your own programs, and it will automatically apply to any subsequent versions
of the program, unless you explicitly add exceptions.

When you use software licensed under the GPL, you are granted the following
freedoms:

  1. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
  2. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do
     what you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
  3. The freedom to redistribute copies of the program so you can help your
     neighbor.
  4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By
     doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your
     changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

This General Public License applies to most software that we distribute. Some
software is released under other licenses, but most of our software is
licensed under the GPL. If you are unsure about which license applies to a
particular software program, feel free to check our website at
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ to find out more.

   c. You must license the modified code under the same GPL license.

2. The above copyright notice and this permission notice must be included in all
   copies or substantial portions of the Program. The Program is distributed
   in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even
   the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
   See the GNU General Public License for more details.

3. If you modify and distribute the Program, you must release the modified code
   under the same GPL License.

4. You may not impose additional restrictions on the rights granted by this
   License.

5. If you convey the Program, it must be accompanied by the source code.
